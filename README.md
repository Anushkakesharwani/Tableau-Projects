* This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built using the "US Accidents" dataset from Kaggle. The dashboard analyzes and visualizes traffic accident data across major U.S. cities and states, highlighting key patterns and insights. It explores accident frequency based on weather conditions (like rain, fog, and snow), identifies common causes such as rear-end collisions and slippery roads, and uncovers trends based on days of the week and specific dates. A geographic heatmap helps visualize accident concentrations in cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, and Chicago. The dataset was cleaned and pre-processed using Excel, and the final dashboard was created in Tableau to allow for interactive exploration of the data..
